This is our first post in this blog. The aim of this page is to share with the international community different aspects and updates of the citizen science project called Cientopolis.

Cientopolis is an Argentinian research project focused on participatory science aka citizen science aka community science. The main page is hosted in the [Oficial Site](http://www.cientopolis.org). The content is written in Spanish. 

However, communication is one of the most important aspects in science, and more in participatory science!. This blog will try to communicate our work in world wide audience. 

We hope this channel becomes in a nice place.
